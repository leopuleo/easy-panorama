[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leopuleo/easy-panorama.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leopuleo/easy-panorama)

Embed interactive wide/panoramic images on your site. Optimised for responsive layouts, it works great with devices equipped with motion sensors.

# Description

Easy Panorama plugin for WordPress websites allows you to display wide/panoramic images in a more accessible way: enjoy your panoramic photos scrolling them on the x-axis or moving your mobile device.

You can start embedding your panoramic images using the handy **shortcode** (TinyMCE editor) or the new **Block**.

Easy Panorama uses the packed [Paver](http://terrymun.github.io/paver/?source=easy-panorama-wp-plugin) :smile:.

# Main features

1. Enqueuing of Paver Javascript and CSS files.
2. Customization of Paver appearance and behaviour from the Panorama Settings page.
3. Other geek settings in the Advanced Settings page.
4. [easy_panorama] shortcode to embed panoramic images with no hassle.
5. Custom Panorama Block for a better editing experience ðŸŽ‰.

## Shortcode (Classic WordPress editor)

![Easy Panorama Shortcode](https://www.adventuresbook.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/easy-panorama-shortcode.gif)

Include your favourite panoramic images in posts and pages using the **built-in shortcode functionality**.

If you are using the classic WordPress editor (TinyMCE), you will find the *Add Panorama* button above the editor: click on the button and select the image you want to include. 
The shortcode will be inserted in the editor and replaced by the panoramic viewer when you visit the website.

You can customize the appearance and behaviour of the panoramic viewer through the Easy Panorama settings page or adding specific attributes to each shortcode: these will override the general settings.

### Shortcode attributes cheat sheet:
* `id`: attachment/image WordPress id *(number)* - **Required**
* `url`: image url *(string)*
* `meta`: determines whether a metadata overlay should be displayed *(boolean)*
* `title`: image title, showed on overlay in case "Show image meta" ("meta" attribute) is set to true  *(string)*
* `alt`: image alternative text, showed on overlay in case "Show image meta" ("meta" attribute) is set to true  *(string)*
* `graceful_failure`: allows the display of failure message *(boolean)*
* `failure_message`: this message will appear in mobile devices with no gyroscopic data or no physical orientation support *(string)*
* `failure_message_insert`: the location where the failure message will be inserted *(before | after)*
* `minimum_overflow`: the excess width the picture must have before panoramic viewer kicks in *(number)*
* `start_position`: the start position of the panorama *(number from 0 to 1)*

## Block (Gutenberg editor)

You can customize the appearance and behaviour of each panoramic viewer thanks to the Inspector Control.
